# Godot 2d Pixel Art Starter Script
I couldn't figure out a longer name and shorter just seemed not as fun. 

Do you find yourself starting projects regularly? Do you not like to continuously do the same steps over and over to setup said project? Well I have written a short little editor script that will setup the pesky bits for you right quick.

I have found that I like to start projects and find it tedious to do the same steps
over and over. So I wrote this script to handle that.
This tool script allows you to quickly setup a 2d pixel art game with some basic settings. 
Feel free to modify this in other ways you want to fit your game dev needs.

Instructions 
- Add the file to your project 
- Open script editor
- Open setup_framework.gd 
- Select File -> Run (from inside the Script Editor window)
